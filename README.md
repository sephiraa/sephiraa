Hi, Iâ€™m @sephiraa

This readme is only being treated as a means to get to know me, or this aspect of my life. I strongly beleive Github is NOT a social media, and will not be treating it as such.

------

I strive to be proficient with any and all skills I want to learn. These skills are often rooted in creativity. 
Some examples include:
- Music, 3D modelling, photo manipulation, writing, worldbuilding, bsp level design, programming, cartography, photography, and cooking.

Iâ€™m constantly learning new things, and strive for trial and error.

As for my interests, there is far to many to count. Some include:
C++, OpenGL rendering, video editing, norse mythology, etymology, shark biology, music production, fictional cartography, etc
