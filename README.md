Hi, Iâ€™m @sephiraa

This readme is only being treated as a means to get to know me, or this aspect of my life. I strongly beleive Github is NOT a social media, and will not be treating it as such.

------

I strive to be proficient with any and all skills I want to learn. These skills are often rooted in creativity. 
Some examples include:
- Music, 3D modelling, photo manipulation, writing, worldbuilding, bsp level design, programming, cartography, photography, and cooking.

Iâ€™m constantly learning new things, and strive for trial and error; I try to learn at least 2 things every day that I can recall. 
It can be something as little as hyperlinking in LibreOffice Calc, making a sphere in Trenchbroom of varying vertices, to what ASCII means (American standard intercode for Info. exchange), that crosswalks now-a-days are useless, e

As for my interests, there is far to many to count. Some exmaples include:
C++, Vulkan/OpenGL, Ue, video editing, norse mythology, etymology, shark biology,

Fun fact: I use to exclusibly stream Alien: Isolation, and Subnautica on mixer for a few years before it shut down. 
Another: My favourite drinks are Arizona Ice Tea, Monster (any), Rockstar (Except original) - buy me some ice tea?

As I have a lot of projects on the go all the time, my current priorities right now are:
Vulpes, SIREN, Refur (Software. Not to be disclosed ANY time soon), and a few Ue 4.27 projects.
