Hi, Iâ€™m @sephiraa

I strive to be proficient with any and all skills I want to learn. These skills are often rooted in creativity. 
Some examples include:
- Music, 3D modelling, photo manipulation, writing, worldbuilding, bsp level design, programming, cartography, photography, and cooking.

Iâ€™m constantly learning new things, and strive for trial and error.
Ie, C++, Vulkan/OpenGL, Ue, video editing, norse mythology, etymology.

Fun fact: I use to only stream Alien: Isolation on my abandoned, and forgotten, mixer page.



As I have a lot of projects on the go all the time, my current priorities right now are:
Vulpes, SIREN, Refur (Software), and a few Unreal Engine 4.27 projects.
